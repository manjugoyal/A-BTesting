# A-BTesting
This project was done as a part of data analysis nanodegree a Udacity. The intent of the project is to do an analysis 
for an online store on whether to keep the old page or shift to a new page that they have created. The entire analysis
was done in Python 3 using Jupyter notebook and the results were also downloaded and stored in a html file. 
The html report can be read as I share my line of thought and code in that.

#Data
Data was provided to me by Udacity.
More about this is already written in the html reportin the repository.
